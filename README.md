## Description
**Word Count**

Website showcasing everything I learned in week 1 of Epicodus around Ruby. This application is to incorporate all the concepts taught this week by creating a webpage (using HTML and Ruby) that uses a method to return how frequently a word appears in a given string. The user should be able to input both the word and the string of words to check.
