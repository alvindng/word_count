# _Word Count_

#### _Individual Ruby Exercise for Epicodus - Ruby week 1, 7.1.16._

#### By _**Alvin Ng**_

## Description
**Word Count**

Website showcasing everything I learned in week 1 Ruby of Epicodus. This application is to incorporate all the concepts taught this week by creating a webpage (using HTML and Ruby) that uses a method to return how frequently a word appears in a given string. The user should be able to input both the word and the string of words to check.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download/clone repository, or visit
https://degrassi-syrup-35998.herokuapp.com/
* To see how many times your word appears in a sentence, enter a word into the 1st form and your sentence in the 2nd form
* Click the _"Let's see the Count!"_ button to see the Count
